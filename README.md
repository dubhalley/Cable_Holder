# Pictures

Show you the project, start with a screenshot of the Freecad drawing.

Then the lasercutted poplar plywood

And the pictures in situation


# Files

You could find here 3 differents formats.

Freecad .fcstd

Inkscape .svg

Autocad .dxf


At the beginning i would 3D print this project, i use freecad to draw the project. but, i realise that is will be a long and large print. 

A long print mean more 10h...

A large print depending of your printer size, and the quality of your heating bed (to prevent warping)


So i decide to lasercut the project, so i export from freecad the .svg file, because a laser cutter need vectoriel.

I also export a .dxf file because sometime some laser cutter prefer this format.
